# PokerPlus

A Poker App for friendly and simple poker play.

Feel free to use this app for your own friends once it's ready or make your own brach and develop your own version!

This version is based off (and using some functionality/graphics) developed by nilssonopel. Check out his single player app here: https://js-css-poker.sourceforge.io/
and pay him his due respects for his amazing work and for giving me a starting point and really doing all the hardwork for me!
